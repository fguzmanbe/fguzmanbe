## More about me

Hello! I'm Francisco, a passionate graduate in Business Engineering from the University of Chile in 2021. After dedicating that year to saving, I decided to embark on an exciting adventure in February of the following year, landing in beautiful Portugal.

My story in this land began as a [volunteer](../../fguzmanbe/travels/2023-11-14-faro/index.html) in a hostel, and over time, I found my way working in the housekeeping area until October 2022. During this period, I had the opportunity to meet incredible people and gradually immerse myself in the rich Portuguese culture.

In search of new challenges, I made the decision with a group of friends to move to Coímbra in October 2022, where I currently call home. Here, I took on the role of Customer Service Representative at Foundever for the Airbnb project, from December 2022 to October 2023.

Now, with a stronger command of the language and greater stability in my new homeland, I have decided to embark on new horizons. My goal is to improve my quality of life and develop professionally.

I am acutely aware of the challenges in demonstrating skills acquired from a foreign university. However, through this website, I hope to showcase not only some of the expertise I possess but, more importantly, my fervor for data. Join me on this digital journey as I navigate the intricacies of my experiences, skills, and a passion that transcends borders. Your presence here is truly appreciated!
