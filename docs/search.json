I’m Francisco, a passionate graduate in Business\r\n            Engineering from the University of Chile in 2021. After\r\n            dedicating that year to saving, I decided to embark on an\r\n            exciting adventure in February of the following year,\r\n            landing in beautiful Portugal.\r\n            My story in this land began as a volunteer in a hostel,\r\n            and over time, I found my way working in the housekeeping\r\n            area until October 2022. During this period, I had the\r\n            opportunity to meet incredible people and gradually immerse\r\n            myself in the rich Portuguese culture.\r\n            In search of new challenges, I made the decision with a\r\n            group of friends to move to Coímbra in October 2022, where I\r\n            currently call home. Here, I took on the role of Customer\r\n            Service Representative at Foundever for the Airbnb project,\r\n            from December 2022 to October 2023.\r\n            Now, with a stronger command of the language and greater\r\n            stability in my new homeland, I have decided to embark on\r\n            new horizons. My goal is to improve my quality of life and\r\n            develop professionally.\r\n            I am acutely aware of the challenges in demonstrating\r\n            skills acquired from a foreign university. However, through\r\n            this website, I hope to showcase not only some of the\r\n            expertise I possess but, more importantly, my fervor for\r\n            data. Join me on this digital journey as I navigate the\r\n            intricacies of my experiences, skills, and a passion that\r\n            transcends borders.
