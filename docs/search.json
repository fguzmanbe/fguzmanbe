I’m Francisco, a passionate graduate in Business\r\n            Engineering from the University of Chile in 2021. After\r\n            dedicating that year to saving, I decided to embark on an\r\n            exciting adventure in February of the following year,\r\n            landing in beautiful Portugal.\r\n            My story in this land began as a volunteer\r\n            in a hostel, and over time, I found my way working in the\r\n            housekeeping area until October 2022. During this period, I\r\n            had the opportunity to meet incredible people and gradually\r\n            immerse myself in the rich Portuguese culture.\r\n            In search of new challenges, I made the decision with a\r\n            group of friends to move to Coímbra in October 2022, where I\r\n            currently call home. Here, I took on the role of Customer\r\n            Service Representative at Foundever for the Airbnb project,\r\n            from December 2022 to October 2023.\r\n            Now, with a stronger command of the language and greater\r\n            stability in my new homeland, I have decided to embark on\r\n            new horizons. My goal is to improve my quality of life and\r\n            develop professionally.\r\n            I am acutely aware of the challenges in demonstrating\r\n            skills acquired from a foreign university. However, through\r\n            this website, I hope to showcase not only some of the\r\n            expertise I possess but, more importantly, my fervor for\r\n            data. Join me on this digital journey as I navigate the\r\n            intricacies of my experiences, skills, and a passion that\r\n            transcends borders.
